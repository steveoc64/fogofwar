<h2>Grand Tactical Movement</h2>
<center><img src="/img/gt-move.png"></center>
<p>The Grand Tactical Movement Phase represents around 20minutes of action, in which large formations 
make large movements across the Battlefield, in "Columns of March".</p>

<h4>Movement of March Columns</h4>
<p>In the space of 20 minutes, a well disciplined infantry unit in march columns can cover almost a mile in exceptional conditions, or typically just over a Km on the average battlefield. This needs to be reflected on the tabletop.</p>
<p>However, it takes at least 20 minutes to organise troops into march columns and pass the orders of the route down the line .. so you may find that some units cannot move at all during this phase as the are "deploying into march order".</p>
<p>Once they reach their destination, the March Column will begin deploying into Line of Battle .. another exersize that takes at least 20 minutes to perform.</p>
<p>At the end of the Grand Tactical Movement Phases, you will be asked if any units in March Order have reached their destination yet .. in which case, the computer will update the map, and begin deploying the unit in Battle Line for you.</p>

<h4>Tabletop Movement Rate</h4>
<p>All Grand Tactical Movement is simultaneous for all players.</p>
<p>Grand Tactical Movement in this phase provides for a movement allowance of up to 3 Grids for all troops in March Order.</p>
<p>To perform this movement on the tabletop, place a single base of figures on the table to represent the head of the column, and then add a few more bases behind it, strung out in march order, for aesthetic effect. If you really want to, you can add escorts to the side of the column, and scouts to the front for extra aesthetics .. up to you, its your table.</p>
<img src="/img/march-column.png">
<p>Please note that the "Grids" on the computer display are there for reference and approximation only, and they do not dictate the measurements of the "reality" of the tabletop. If there is any discrepency between the computer map vs the tabletop, the tabletop interpretation always takes precedence. This is perfectly in line with the realities of real life military operations, and reading maps.<p>
<p>The movement allowance is 3 grids maximum. If there is ANY rough terrain on the path within the range of this movement phase, then reduce the allowance to a maximum of 2 grids. Passing down a slope counts as rough terrain for movement, and is therefore limited to 2 grids maximum.</p>
<p>Finally, if the move involves passing through woods, or built up areas, or up a slope, then the maximum move is reduced to 1 grid.</p>
<p>To measure the actual distance travelled on the tabletop, use a measuring stick marked off in equal portions of exactly 1 grid size (ie. 4" 6" 8" 1ft .. whatever grid size you are using on this table.), and apply it as follows :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Place the movement stick such that the base representing the head of the column is wholly within one of the "grid squares". It can be at the close end or the far end of the grid square, as long is its within the grid square.</li>
  <li>Aim the movement stick at the target objective, using common sense to determine the best route of march. If in doubt, reach a consensus with the other players from both sides. As long as everyone applies the same "common sense" approach equally, then you are all good.</li>
  <li>The base of figures representing the head of the column can then be moved to a position that is anywhere inside the 3rd Grid square from its current location, as measured on the measuring stick. It can be placed anywhere in that square, as long as it it wholly within that square.</li>
  <li>If the movement allowance is LESS than 3 grids, then apply that to the above - ie. the head of the column could be moved into the 2nd or the next grid square, depending on the movement allowance.</li>
  <li>Note: Because you can place the head of the column anywhere within the start square, and anywhere within the end square, this provides some built in adjustment for extending or reducing the actual distance travelled on the tabletop by roughly +/- 1 Grid Square. Its quite simple and elegant once you get the hang of it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Examples of Legal Move Variations</h4>
<p>Both of these examples see the unit making a legal move of "3 Grids"</p>
<img src="/img/legal-max.png"><br>
<img src="/img/legal-min.png"><br>
<p>Both of these cases can be useful, as there are times when you want to push the men a bit faster, and there are times when you wish you could halt the movement before it ends in certain disaster.</p>


<h4>Partial Movement due to Enemy Contact</h4>
<p>Units performing Grand Tactical Moves in March Order can move up to their full allowance, unless such movement places them in a "Zone of Contact" with the enemy, which is simply defined as being within 1 grid of any enemy unit of any time. Under no circumstances can Grand Tactical movement place troops any closer to the enemy than 1 grid.<p>
<p>At the end of the Grand Tactical Movement Phases, you will be asked if any March Columns have contacted the enemy in this manner, and the computer will look after the details from there. In general, such March Columns will automatically begin deploying into Battle Line, and take a defensive posture .. but once again, let the computer manage this for you.</p>


<h4>What about Cavalry, horse drawn Guns and Light Troops ?</h4>
<p>Note that there are 2 phases of Grand Tactical Movement per 20 minute turn. The first phase gives everyone "3 Grids of Movement". Following this, there is a phase for calculating the effect of any Artillery Bombardments on troops during the movement phase.  Following the Bombardment, Cavalry, horse drawn, and Light Skirmisher troops get a 2nd Grand Tactical movement allowance, depending on the situation. Best case is that unmolested Light Cavalry in good conditions may get up to 2 grids extra movement allowance, with skirmisher infantry typically getting an extra half-grid of special movement allowance.</p>

<h4>General Advance in Line of Battle</h4>
<p>Formed units in Battle Line perform all of their movements and other actions during the tactical phases.</p>


<img src="/img/battle-line.png"><br>

<p>Units that are in Line of Battle formation can be given orders for a "General Advance"</p>
<p>If so ordered, the affected troops will spend the first Grand Tactical Phase "Sounding the Order", dressing their lines, fixing their bayonets, and otherwise getting ready for some serious action.</p>
<p>The drums and bugles sound out the call, and during the next Grand Tactical Movement Phases, the whole unit will advance in formation, with Bayonets at the ready.</p>
<p>The whole line can continue to advance in this manner whilst keeping formation, at a rate of 1 grid maximum per Grand Tactical Movement Phase.</p>
<p>Proceeding on a General Advance will cost the entire formation 1 level of fatigue per quarter mile advanced every 20 minute turn. A good unit should be able to maintain this General Advance for 6 or more moves,  lesser units will be able to keep it up for 2-3 moves before suffering significant effects.</p>
<p>Once on a General Advance, halting it or reversing the order is still possible, but takes time and may cause some confusion with the troops.</p>
<p>Only call a General Advance when you are certain of Victory, and want to make sure that you really want to show no quarter, and clear the table of the enemy before packing up the game for the day.</p>
